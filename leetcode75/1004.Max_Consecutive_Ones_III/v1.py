LeetCode 1004: Max Consecutive Ones III - Sliding Window Approach

ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
This problem asks for the maximum length of consecutive 1's after flipping at most k zeros.
The key insight is to use a sliding window approach.

OPTIMAL APPROACH (Not implemented here):
The current solution has a flawed approach. The correct algorithm should be:
1. Use two pointers (left, right) to maintain a sliding window
2. Expand the window by moving right pointer
3. Keep track of zeros in current window
4. When zeros exceed k, shrink window from left until zeros â‰¤ k
5. Track maximum window size throughout

CURRENT SOLUTION ANALYSIS:
The implemented approach tries to count consecutive 1s and 0s separately, but this doesn't
correctly handle the sliding window concept needed for this problem.

STEP-BY-STEP WALKTHROUGH OF CURRENT APPROACH:
1. Initialize counters for ones and zeros in current window
2. Process consecutive 1s first
3. Then process consecutive 0s  
4. Calculate maximum possible length by adding ones + min(zeros, k)
5. Reset counters based on next element type

ISSUES WITH CURRENT APPROACH:
- Doesn't properly implement sliding window
- Resets counters incorrectly
- May have index out of bounds errors
- Doesn't track the actual consecutive sequence correctly

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n) - single pass through array
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1) - constant extra space

CORRECT SLIDING WINDOW APPROACH:
def longestOnes(self, nums, k):
    left = 0
    zeros_count = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[right] == 0:
            zeros_count += 1
        
        while zeros_count > k:
            if nums[left] == 0:
                zeros_count -= 1
            left += 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length
