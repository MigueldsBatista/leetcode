    LeetCode 1768: Merge Strings Alternately

    Problem:
    You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters 
    in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, 
    append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

    Original Solution Issues:
    - Using pop(0) on lists is O(n) operation, making overall complexity O(nÂ²)
    - Converting strings to lists unnecessarily
    - Multiple loops when one would suffice

    Improved Solution:
    - Use index-based iteration for O(n) time complexity
    - Single loop to handle alternating merge
    - Direct string operations
